This shows a very simple receiver to help you get code up and running. You can
think of this as your first step. It is not compatible with our UX guidelines.
It is useful for learning the basic concepts of the system.

While this receiver doesn't have any text, it's important to know that
Chromecast defaults to a black background with black text.  Changing that will
help your efforts.

We find that having everything fit in the HTML boxes tends to look nicer on TV
so, we also set overflow: hidden, which clips all flowing outside of boxes or
adding of scrollbars, which aren't useful on TV.
